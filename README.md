# ReactMyAdmin ( Development )

Project in development for a Database Management System, a mirror of myPhpAdmin but written in JS with react, with a scifi interface using Arwes, ReactJS and Node, and later, export to application with Electron

## Usage


In the project root folder, run the following commands in terminal
to run the server.
```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/ARCANGEL0/ReactMyAdmin.git
   $ cd ReactMyAdmin
   $ npm install
   $ npm start
```
And then just access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project under development
Make sure you have Mysql installed and if it's running!





# Executable 

At the moment, I still haven't used Electronjs to compile React into an executable.
